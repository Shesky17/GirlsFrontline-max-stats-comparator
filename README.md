# Gfl-max-stats-lookup-and-compare

A simple tool that makes comparing and looking up T-dolls' max stats easier.

## Why tho?
I'm tired of repeatedly pressing ctrl-f while using gfwiki and my eyes hurt.

## How does it work?
Data is scraped from Girls' Frontline Wiki with BeautifulSoup. Basically a T-Doll search that only returns stats.

## How to use?
Console or GUI, you pick one. I recommend using the GUI for a more user-friendly experience.

## Dependencies
```
    apt-get install python3-tk
    pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```

## Future idea
Who doens't like a web app? Might put it on my website, if I can survive sophomore year and get my lazy ass up and code..
